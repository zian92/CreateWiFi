How to create your own WiFi with .bat-files.

Installation
=========

Download the .bat-files and save them at a destination you will find them. (If you download a zip-file, unpack it at first!)
Right-click on the wlanstart-file and change "Your WiFi" to a WiFi-name that pleases you. Change also the key. It will be the key you need to connect to your WiFi.
Save your changes and close the window.
Now right-click on the wlanstart-file and choose run as administrator. You have your self-hosted WiFi!


Limited Internet Acces
==========

If you can't acces the internet from a connected device do the following:
Enter the Control Panel to change your adapter settings. (If you don't know where to find them, google that problem depending on your operating system)
Right-click on the adapter which is connected to the internet. 
Choose Propertys. 
Hit the Sharing tab.
Allow other users to use your internetconnection. (Probably you can decide, which connection they can use. Choose the one that is connected to the internet!)
Confirm all changes and close the windows.
\n
That should solve your problem.
